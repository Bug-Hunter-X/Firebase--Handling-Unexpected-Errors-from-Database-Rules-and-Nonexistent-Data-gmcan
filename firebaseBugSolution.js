To avoid errors caused by restrictive security rules, carefully review and test your Firebase Realtime Database rules.  Ensure that your rules allow the necessary read and write operations for your application.  Use a tool like the Firebase Rules Simulator to test your rules before deploying them. 
To handle cases where data might not exist, always check for null or undefined values before attempting to access properties of the data.  Consider using optional chaining or the nullish coalescing operator to gracefully handle missing data.  Adding explicit checks such as `if (data !== null && typeof data === 'object')` can prevent unexpected errors.   For example:

```javascript
// Instead of:
const userName = snapshot.val().user.name;

// Use:
const userName = snapshot.val()?.user?.name || 'Unknown';
```
This ensures that if `snapshot.val()`, `user` or `name` are null or undefined, the code won't throw an error and will instead use a default value.
