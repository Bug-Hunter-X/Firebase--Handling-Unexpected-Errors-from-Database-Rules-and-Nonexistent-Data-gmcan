The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the rules in your Firebase Realtime Database are too restrictive.  For example, if you're trying to write data to a location that your security rules don't allow, you'll get an error.  This can be especially tricky to debug because the error message might not be very specific.  You might see a generic 'Permission denied' message, but the root cause could be something subtle in your security rules.  Another scenario is if your application tries to access a node or data that does not exist.  The application might not explicitly check for existence before reading, leading to an unexpected null or undefined result, subsequently causing further errors down the line.  Debugging this often involves careful examination of your code and your database rules.
